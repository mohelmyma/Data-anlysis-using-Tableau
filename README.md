Summary : As you can see this graph illustrates the total delay time across the year for the different airlines in the US. And as obvious WN airline has the highest delayed time. Also, you can see, all airlines have high delay time between June & August.
Design :
• First, I made a calculation field to add the total delay time to one column called (Total Delay).
• I pulled (month) to columns and (Total Delay) to rows.
• I pulled (Airline) to color so you can see the different trends for each airline.
• I made a filtration with (airline) & (airport) to see the changes in the delay time for each airline & airport.

Summary : This chart illustrates the delayed time for each part in the flight for a specific airline. For AA airline , you can see that most of the delay time because of the departure delay. On the other hand, the least reason for delay is the security.
Design :
• First, I pulled the different reasons for delay to columns and the sum of each delay time to rows.
• I added (airport, airline & month) to filters so I can see the change in delay time across time and for different airlines & airports.

Summary : This bar chart illustrates the number of cancelled flights for different reasons for each airline in the US. And as you can see, most of the cancelled flights for all the airlines is because of the weather issues. WN airline has the highest number of cancelled flights due to weather issues.
The second graph (The map) illustrates the state that has the highest number of cancellations due to weather condition. As obvious Texas state has the highest number of cancelled flights because of the bad weather.
Design :
• First, I made calculation field to the (cancelled reason from (A,B,C,D) to the actual reason (Security, weather, …) .
• I added the new column to rows and airline to columns.
• I added the new column (Number of cancelled flights) to color. So, I can visualize the proportion of the different reasons with different colors for each airline using stacked bar type.
• I opened a new worksheet, and I made a new calculation field where I summed the number of cancelled flights due to weather.
• Then, I pulled that new column & state column to color. So I can visualize the number of cancelled flights for each state.
